Today marks the first day in my online blogging journey. I have decided to create a blog and share my thoughts in a place
that is not Facebook or Twitter. Honestly, I am not much of a social media buff. My passion in life is Information Technology.
It is such an exciting field to be a part of. It really works out if you are a person who gets bored easily. You can spend
100's if not 1000's of hours learning a particular topic and the next you will realize you just scratched the surface.

I hope to add a collection of my profession and personal thoughts for you to digest.
If there is any topic that you would like to see on this website, please feel free
to reach out to me.
