Today marks the first day in my online blogging journey. I have decided to create a blog and share my thoughts in a place
that is not Facebook or Twitter. Honestly, I am not much of a social media buff. My passion in life is Information Technology.
It is such an exciting filed to be a part of. It really works out if you are a person who gets bored easily. You can spend
100's if not 1000's of hours learning a particular topic and the next you will realize you just scratched the surface.


The platform that I am using to host my website is Github.io. Not only, is it hosting my main website but it is also taking
care of the hosting for this blog too. There are a few good references that I can point you to if you are reading this and
want to get started with a similar setup. All you need is a domain name, which is $10 for a year.
