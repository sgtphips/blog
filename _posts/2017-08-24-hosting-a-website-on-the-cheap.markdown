Hosting a website on the cheap
==============================

...It is August 2017 and there are so many different ways that a person can setup a website for themselves. The setup that you use should be based on your over all goal. Is this a personal or profession website? That is the question that I would ask myself before anything else. The reason behind this is that you need to know the limitations and fuctionality of your website before you create anything. For example, if I need a website to sell my goods and services then I need to research websites that their main function is selling goods and services. Wix.com is a free website builder that comes to mind. Wix is a drag and drop website builder that makes creating websites pretty simple for the person who needs a quick and easy solution.

Here are some benefits to using a service like Wix.com to setup your website:
