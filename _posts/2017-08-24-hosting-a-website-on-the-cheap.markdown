It is August 2017 and there are so many different ways that a person can setup a website for themselves. The setup that you use should be based on your over all goal. Is this a personal or profession website? That is the question that I would ask myself before anything else. 

The reason behind this is that you need to know the limitations and fuctionality of your website before you create anything. For example, if I need a website to sell my goods and services then I need to research websites that their main function is selling goods and services. 

Wix.com is a free website builder that comes to mind. Wix is a drag and drop website builder that makes creating websites pretty simple for the person who needs a quick and easy solution.


Here are some benefits to using a service like Wix.com to setup your website:

## Cost
----
* You can get started with a wix.com website for free!! You just have to sign up with them and prepare to get spammed. They will continously spam you, trying to get you to upgrade to their premium service. The major benefit to this is that it will remove the wix.com branding from your webpages. If you are just trying to set something up on the fly then I wouldn't worry about it too much.



## Setup Time
----
* In theory, you can setup a wix.com website in less than an hour. I had to use this tool to create a website for a school project. It was pretty easy to use.

## Difficulty
----
* Super easy to use and setup! Plus there are a ton of youtube and help videos to get you started.
